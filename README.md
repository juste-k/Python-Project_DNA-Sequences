# Python-Project_DNA-Sequences
- The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my Python coding skills and ability to analyse DNA sequences in multi-FASTA format.

- The goal is to answer the following questions:
  (1) How many records are in the file?
  (2) What are the lengths of the sequences in the file? What is the longest sequence and what is the shortest sequence? Is there more than one longest or           shortest sequence? What are their identifiers?
  (3) What is the length of the longest open reading frame (ORF) in the file? What is the identifier of the sequence containing the longest ORF? For a given sequence identifier, what is the longest ORF contained in the sequence represented by that identifier? What is the starting position of the longest ORF in the sequence that contains it?
  (4) Given a length n, the program should be able to identify all repeats of length n in all sequences in the FASTA file. The program should also determine how many times each repeat occurs in the file, and which is the most frequent repeat of a given length.

# Files
- `DNA-seq.py` - Python script for answering the questions

- `dna.fasta` - example file to test Python script
